quadcopter-beagle
=================

This project will enable us to build a quadcopter on the ARM-Cortex BeagleBone platform

The Beagle Folder contains the Kernel Driver Code. /beagle
  -> Will eventually contain:
    -> i2c code
    -> Kernel Code
    -> Motor Logic
The Debugger folder contains the QTcpServer Remote Data Acquisition
  -> Will eventually be used for
    -> OpenCV analysis
    -> Debugging
    ->Verifying specific sensor data
